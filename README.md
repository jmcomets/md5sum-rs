md5sum-rs
=========

This is a re-implementation of the [GNU Coreutils][] `md5sum` program.

There's already a [project](https://gitlab.com/core-utils/core-utils) working
on a full rewrite of all the GNU Coreutils, which includes md5sum. I don't see
why you would prefer using this toy instead of their more mature
implementation.
